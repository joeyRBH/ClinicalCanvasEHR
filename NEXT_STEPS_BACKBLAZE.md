Subject: Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Request for HIPAA Compliance

Dear Backblaze Support,

I am developing a HIPAA-compliant Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and am using Backblaze B2 to store Protected Health Information (PHI) for my healthcare application.

As required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), I need to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Backblaze before processing any PHI.

Could you please provide me with:
1. A copy of your standard BAA
2. Instructions for executing the BAA
3. Any additional requirements or certifications needed

My application details:
- Platform: ClinicalCanvas EHR
- Production URL: https://clinicalcanvas.app
- Service: Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage
- Expected launch date: [Your Date]

I appreciate your assistance in helping me maintain HIPAA compliance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Email]
[Your Phone]
```

4. **Wait** for response (usually 1-3 business days)

## üîß After Backblaze Setup

Once you've completed the steps above, let me know and I'll help you:

1. **Create API endpoints** for document upload/download
2. **Integrate** Backblaze into ClinicalCanvas
3. **Update** the frontend to use Backblaze storage
4. **Test** the integration
5. **Deploy** to production

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

For a small practice (50-100 clients):
- **Documents**: 50 GB = $0.25/month
- **Recordings**: 100 GB = $0.50/month
- **Backups**: 50 GB = $0.25/month

Even with generous usage, you'll stay well under $20/month!
