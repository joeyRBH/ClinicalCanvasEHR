## 🎯 Quick Deploy (Recommended)

### Option 1: Demo Mode (No Database Required)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com
2. **Click "Add New Project"**
3. **Import from GitHub**: Select `joeyRBH/clinicalspeak`
4. **Configure Project**:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Root Directory: `./` (default)
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: `public`
5. **Environment Variables**: Skip this - demo mode works without any!
6. **Click "Deploy"**

**That's it!** Your app will run in demo mode with all features working.

### Option 2: With Database (Optional)

If you want to use a real database:

1. **Set up Neon Database**:
   - Go to https://neon.tech
   - Create a free account
   - Create a new project
   - Copy the connection string

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Follow steps 1-4 from Option 1
   - In **Environment Variables**, add:
     - Key: `DATABASE_URL`
     - Value: Your Neon connection string
     - Key: `JWT_SECRET`
     - Value: A secure random string (generate one at https://randomkeygen.com)

3. **Initialize Database**:
   - After deployment, run the SQL from `schema.sql` in your Neon dashboard
   - This creates all necessary tables

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Not Triggering?

1. **Check Repository Connection**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
   - Verify the repository is connected
   - Check that the production branch is set to `main`

2. **Verify GitHub Integration**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Applications → Vercel
   - Make sure Vercel has access to the repository

3. **Manual Deploy**:
   - In Vercel Dashboard, click "Deployments"
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit

### Build Failing?

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Cannot find module"** errors:
   - This should be fixed now with our conditional SQL client initialization
   - If you see this, make sure you pushed the latest commits

2. **Environment Variable Issues**:
   - For demo mode: Don't add any environment variables
   - For database mode: Add both `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`

3. **API Route Errors**:
   - Check the Function Logs in Vercel Dashboard
   - Verify that `api/` folder is in the repository

### App Deployed But Not Working?

1. **Check Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions
   - Click on any failed function to see errors

2. **Test API Endpoints**:
   - Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/login`
   - Should return a CORS-enabled response (not 404)

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open your deployed app
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Check Console tab for errors

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Status

### For Production Use
- ⚠️ Add strong `JWT_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables
- ⚠️ Set up proper database with encryption
