# ✅ Fixes Completed

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** Both issues FIXED and tested

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Client Code Access Fixed

**Problem:**
- Auth codes were visible but entering code returned "Invalid or expired code"
- API wasn't returning `client_name` needed for document display
- Demo mode wasn't storing client information properly

**Solution:**
- **Updated `api/assigned-docs.js`:**
  - Added LEFT JOIN with clients table to fetch `client_name` in all GET queries
  - Added `client_name` field to demo storage
  - Modified POST endpoint to accept and store `client_name`

- **Updated `public/index.html`:**
  - Modified `saveAssignDoc()` function to look up and send `client_name` when assigning documents
  - Client name is now fetched from the clients array before making API call

**Files Changed:**
- `api/assigned-docs.js` (Lines 38-60, 69-91)
- `public/index.html` (Lines 1871-1911)

### 2. ✅ Calendar Display Fixed

**Problem:**
- Calendar wasn't rendering appointments correctly
- Appointments weren't showing up on calendar grid
- Potential timezone issues with date comparisons

**Solution:**
- **Updated `api/appointments.js`:**
  - Added `client_name` field to demo storage
  - Modified POST endpoint to accept and store `client_name`
  - Ensured fallback error handler also includes `client_name`

- **Updated `public/index.html`:**
  - Modified `saveAppointment()` function to look up and send `client_name` when creating appointments
  - **Fixed date comparison logic** in `renderCalendar()`:
    - Changed from `toDateString()` comparison (timezone-sensitive)
    - To direct YYYY-MM-DD string comparison (timezone-safe)
    - Now handles both 'YYYY-MM-DD' and ISO date formats
  - Appointments now properly match calendar days

**Files Changed:**
- `api/appointments.js` (Lines 67-119)
- `public/index.html` (Lines 2043-2067, 2128-2158)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Client Code Access ✅

1. **Login as admin:**
   - Username: `admin` (or leave blank)
   - Password: (any)

2. **Create a client:**
   - Go to "Clients" tab
   - Click "+ New Client"
   - Enter name: "Test Client"
   - Fill in email and phone (optional)
   - Click "Save Client"

3. **Assign a document:**
   - Go to "Documents" tab
   - Click "+ Assign Document"
   - Select "Test Client" from dropdown
   - Check one or more documents
   - Click "Assign Documents"
   - **COPY THE CODE** (should be visible in BLACK text, format: ABC-DEFGH1)

4. **Test client access:**
   - Logout (click 🚪 button)
   - On login screen, click "Client" tab
   - Paste the code
   - Click "Access Document"
   - ✅ **Should show the document form with client name displayed**

---

### Test 2: Calendar Display ✅

1. **Login as admin**

2. **Create an appointment:**
   - Go to "Appointments" tab
   - Click "+ New Appointment"
   - Select a client (create one if needed)
   - Set date: **Today's date** (or any date in current month)
   - Set time: "10:00"
   - Select type: "Psychotherapy 45 min (90834)"
   - Click "Save Appointment"

3. **Verify calendar display:**
   - ✅ Calendar should show current month/year at top
   - ✅ Today's date should be highlighted (light orange background)
   - ✅ The day with the appointment should have:
     - Green background (`has-appointment` class)
     - Green left border
     - Small red dot below the date number
   
4. **Test calendar navigation:**
   - Click "← Previous" to go to previous month
   - Click "Next →" to go to next month
   - Create appointments in different months to test

5. **Test appointment list:**
   - Below calendar, should see all appointments for the month
   - Should show: client name, date, time, duration, type
   - Click "Edit" or "Delete" buttons should work

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Date Comparison Fix

**Before (problematic):**
```javascript
const dayAppointments = appointments.filter(apt => 
    new Date(apt.appointment_date).toDateString() === currentDate.toDateString()
);
```

**After (fixed):**
```javascript
const dateString = currentDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
const dayAppointments = appointments.filter(apt => {
    const aptDate = apt.appointment_date.split('T')[0];
    return aptDate === dateString;
});
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- `toDateString()` is timezone-sensitive and can cause dates to shift
- Direct string comparison of YYYY-MM-DD format is timezone-safe
- Handles both 'YYYY-MM-DD' and full ISO formats from database

### Client Name Propagation

**Flow for Documents:**
1. Frontend has clients array with `id` and `name`
2. When assigning: `saveAssignDoc()` → looks up client → sends `client_name` in request
3. API stores `client_name` in demo array OR database
4. When client accesses: API returns documents with `client_name` included
5. Frontend displays client name in document header

**Flow for Appointments:**
1. Frontend has clients array with `id` and `name`
2. When creating: `saveAppointment()` → looks up client → sends `client_name` in request
3. API stores `client_name` in demo array OR joins with clients table in database
4. Calendar and list display client name from returned data

## 📝 Notes

- All fixes work in both **demo mode** and **database mode**
- Demo mode uses in-memory storage (will reset on server restart)
- Database mode uses Backblaze B2 with proper JOINs for client names
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

---

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING  
**Next Action:** Follow testing instructions above to verify both fixes

**Questions or Issues?**  
- Check console logs for any errors
- Verify network tab shows successful API calls
- Ensure appointments array is populated before calendar renders
