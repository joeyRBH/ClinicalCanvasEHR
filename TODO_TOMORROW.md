# 🔧 Fix Tomorrow Morning

## Remaining Issues (2):

### 1. **Calendar Display Issue**
- Calendar is not rendering correctly
- Appointments may not be showing up on calendar grid
- **Fix:** Check calendar styling and appointment date matching logic
- **File:** `public/index.html` - `renderCalendar()` function

### 2. **Client Code Access Not Working**
- Auth codes are visible (BLACK text ✅)
- But entering code returns "Invalid or expired code"
- **Likely causes:**
  - No documents actually assigned in demo mode
  - assigned-docs API not returning data properly
  - Auth code not matching between assignment and lookup
- **Fix:** 
  - Test by actually assigning a document first
  - Check if assigned-docs API is returning data
  - Verify auth code is being stored and retrieved correctly
- **Files:** 
  - `api/assigned-docs.js` (API endpoint)
  - `public/index.html` - `accessDocument()` function

## ✅ What's Working:

- Login (demo mode) ✅
- Client management (add, edit, delete) ✅
- Appointments (create, edit, delete) ✅
- Document text is BLACK ✅
- Auth codes are BLACK and visible ✅
- Audit log displays ✅
- All APIs respond properly ✅

## 🔍 Testing Steps for Tomorrow:

### Test 1: Calendar
1. Login as admin
2. Go to "Appointments" tab
3. Create a new appointment for today
4. Check if it appears on calendar grid
5. Try navigating months (previous/next)

### Test 2: Client Code
1. Login as admin
2. Create a client (if none exist)
3. Go to "Documents" tab
4. Click "Assign Document"
5. Select client and a document (checkbox)
6. Click "Assign"
7. **COPY THE CODE** that appears (should be BLACK)
8. Logout
9. On login screen, click "Client" tab
10. Paste the code
11. Should show the document (not error)

## 💡 Quick Fixes to Try:

### For Calendar:
```javascript
// Check if appointments array has correct date format
// Verify appointment_date is 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
```

### For Client Code:
```javascript
// Option 1: Test with a real code
// Option 2: Check assigned-docs demo array
// Option 3: Add console.log to see what API returns
```
