# üîß Fix Tomorrow Morning

- But entering code returns "Invalid or expired code"
- **Likely causes:**
  - No documents actually assigned in demo mode
  - assigned-docs API not returning data properly
  - Auth code not matching between assignment and lookup
- **Fix:** 
  - Test by actually assigning a document first
  - Check if assigned-docs API is returning data
  - Verify auth code is being stored and retrieved correctly
- **Files:** 
  - `index.html` - `accessDocument()` function (now using localStorage)
  - Check localStorage for assigned_docs data

  - localStorage data not persisting correctly
- **Fix Priority:** HIGH - blocks core functionality
- **Files:**
