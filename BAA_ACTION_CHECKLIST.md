# Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Action Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL: Sign These BAAs Before Going Live with Real Patient Data

### Why BAAs Are Required

Under HIPAA, you must have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with any vendor that:
- Stores PHI (Protected Health Information)
- Processes PHI
- Transmits PHI
- Has access to PHI

**Without BAAs, you are NOT HIPAA compliant and could face significant fines.**

**Note:** Stripe does NOT require a BAA because they only process payment information, not PHI.

- Stripe is PCI DSS compliant (payment security standard)
