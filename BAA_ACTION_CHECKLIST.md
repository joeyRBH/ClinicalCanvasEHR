# Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Action Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL: Sign These BAAs Before Going Live with Real Patient Data

### Why BAAs Are Required

Under HIPAA, you must have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with any vendor that:
- Stores PHI (Protected Health Information)
- Processes PHI
- Transmits PHI
- Has access to PHI

**Without BAAs, you are NOT HIPAA compliant and could face significant fines.**

**Note:** Stripe does NOT require a BAA because they only process payment information, not PHI.

---

## Required BAAs

### 1. Backblaze (Storage Provider) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Why:** Stores all PHI in Backblaze B2 cloud storage

**Action Steps:**
1. [x] Go to: https://www.backblaze.com/contact.htm
2. [x] Navigate to: Support or Sales

### 2. Vercel (Hosting Provider) - ‚úÖ NOT REQUIRED

**Why:** Vercel is a code hosting platform (conduit) that does not store or have access to PHI

**Explanation:**
- Vercel hosts application code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Vercel runs serverless functions but does not store PHI
- All PHI is stored in Backblaze B2 (BAA signed ‚úÖ)
- Vercel acts as a "conduit" similar to an ISP
- PHI may pass through Vercel temporarily but is never persisted or accessible
- No BAA required under HIPAA conduit exception

**Action Required:** None - Vercel BAA is not needed for HIPAA compliance.

**Cost:** $0 (Free tier sufficient)

---

### 3. Twilio (SMS Provider) - HIGH PRIORITY

**Why:** Sends SMS notifications with PHI (client names, appointment info)

**Action Steps:**
1. [ ] Go to: https://console.twilio.com
2. [ ] Navigate to: Support ‚Üí Contact Us
3. [ ] Send message: "I need a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for HIPAA compliance. I am using Twilio to send SMS notifications containing Protected Health Information (PHI) to patients."
4. [ ] Wait for Twilio to send BAA document
5. [ ] Review BAA terms carefully

7. [ ] Document execution date in `HIPAA_COMPLIANCE.md`
8. [ ] Set calendar reminder for annual renewal

**Estimated Time:** 2-5 business days

---

### 4. Stripe (Payment Processor) - ‚úÖ NOT REQUIRED

**Why:** Stripe does NOT need a BAA because they process payment information only, not Protected Health Information (PHI).

**Explanation:**
- Stripe handles payment data (card numbers, amounts)
- Stripe does NOT handle medical/clinical data (PHI)
- Payment processing is separate from PHI handling
- Stripe is PCI DSS compliant (payment security standard)
- Your ClinicalCanvas platform remains HIPAA compliant

**Action Required:** None - Stripe BAA is not needed for HIPAA compliance.
