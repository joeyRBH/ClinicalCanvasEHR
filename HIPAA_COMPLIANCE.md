## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

✅ **Implemented:**
- Username/password authentication for clinicians
- Session-based authentication with configurable timeouts
- "Remember Me" option with extended 30-day sessions
- Standard sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure logout functionality that clears all session data
- Role-based access control (admin, clinician roles)

**Technical Details:**
- Session tokens stored in `sessionStorage` (temporary) or `localStorage` (remember me)
- Session expiration timestamps enforced on every page load
- Automatic session cleanup on logout or expiration

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

✅ **Implemented:**
- All user inputs validated on frontend
- Server-side validation for API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- Phone number format validation (E.164 standard)
- Email address validation
- Date format validation

**Technical Details:**
- Validation utilities in `api/utils/validator.js`
- Frontend validation before API calls
- Server-side validation as final security layer

### 3. Rate Limiting

✅ **Implemented:**
- API rate limiting per IP address
- Login attempt rate limiting (prevents brute force)
- Document access rate limiting
- Configurable limits per endpoint

**Technical Details:**
- Rate limiter in `api/utils/rateLimiter.js`

  - API calls: 100 requests per minute
  - Document access: 10 attempts per hour

### 4. Security Headers

✅ **Implemented:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Technical Details:**
- Headers configured in `api/middleware/errorHandler.js`
- Applied to all API responses
- Enforced by Vercel platform

### 5. Error Handling

✅ **Implemented:**
- No PHI in error messages
- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed errors logged server-side only
- Error logging to audit trail

**Technical Details:**
- Error handler in `api/middleware/errorHandler.js`
